Look at the user stories sections of Part 1 and Part 2 to get a mental image of what the app will do/be
    User Stories
    As a user, I want to go to a home page to search a database full of movies.
    As a user, I want to see movie results based on my search query.
    As a user, I want to pick a movie result and see detailed information about the movie.

Make a list of all the routes you'll need for this app along with their CRUD functionality and HTTP verbs (see the tables from RESTful Creatures for an example) [HINT: there will be 5 routes total]

VERB | URL                           | Action (CRUD)    | Description
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GET  |  /                            | Index (Read)     | shows a form to input search query for movie title
GET  |  /movies                      | Show (Read)      | displays the movie results based on the search query
GET  |  /movies/:movie_id            | Show (Read)      | shows the selected movie result and detailed info about the movie
POST |  /movies/faves                | Create (Create)  | creates a fave movie with the POST payload data
GET  |  /movies/faves                | Show (Read)      | displays the fave movie results based on the form results

Once you're done, get started on the skeleton of the app. Hold off on the API and Database stuff
